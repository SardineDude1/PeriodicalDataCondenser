# PeriodicalDataCondenser
This is a python script used to condense circulation data by location code for the periodical holdings of library systems.

This script was used to dedupe items with the same name and provide a sum of total circulations and renewals for each title, rather than issue, in order to better assess how library patrons were using the magazine collection at a single branch and across the system.
